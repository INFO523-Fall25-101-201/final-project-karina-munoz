## Overview

This project explores the relationship between a galaxy’s recessional velocity and its distance from Earth to estimate the Hubble Constant (H₀). 
The aim is to apply regression and visualization techniques from data mining to real astronomical data and compare the resulting H₀ estimate to accepted 
cosmological values (~70 km/s/Mpc).  

This topic was chosen because it bridges my astronomy background with the data-mining skills developed in INFO 523. 
My self-taught component will be learning and applying linear regression to incorporate measurement uncertainty into the model.

## Dataset


The dataset used in this project contains observational data of nearby galaxies, including their recession velocities (km/s) and 
distances (Mpc). It is sourced from publicly available astronomical catalogs, such as the 
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) or curated datasets on Kaggle (Galaxy Distance–Velocity Data).  

I chose this dataset because it provides direct, measurable quantities for verifying Hubble's law, which links galaxy velocity to 
distance. It’s small enough for reproducible analysis (typically 200 galaxies), but still captures meaningful variation across galaxies.

## Questions

Can a linear regression model accurately reproduce Hubble’s Law from observed galaxy data?
How does incorporating uncertainty (weighted regression) affect the estimated value of the Hubble Constant?


## Analysis plan

Week 1: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis — scatterplots, correlation checks.
Week 2: Fit standrad linear regression model and compute slope/intercept.
Week 3: Implement weighted regression using uncertainty values to refine
Week 4: Visualize residuals, calculate confidence intervals, and compare results to NASA’s published H₀ range.
Week 5: Write final report, generate presentation, and interpret discrepancies.

## Expected Outcomes

- A numerical estimate of H-const with uncertainty analysis.
- Visualizations (scatterplot with regression line, residual plots).
- Discussion comparing the computed constant to established cosmological values and sources of error.
- Reflection on how data-mining and regression methods apply to real scientific data.
