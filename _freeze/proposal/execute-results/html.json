Using regression and visualization techniques from data mining, the project applies linear modeling to real astronomical observations and compares the resulting estimate of $H_0$ to established cosmological values (approximately 70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$).\n\nThis topic was chosen because it bridges my background in astronomy with the data-mining methods developed in INFO 523. The project is designed to explore how simple regression models perform on real scientific data, as well as how assumptions and uncertainty influence scientific inference.\n\n---\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe dataset used in this project consists of Type Ia supernova observations, including redshift-derived recession velocities and luminosity distances. The data are sourced from publicly available astronomical supernova compilations, such as the Pantheon+ dataset.\n\nThis dataset was selected because Type Ia supernovae serve as well-calibrated standard candles, making them well suited for studying the cosmic expansion rate. The dataset is large enough to support meaningful statistical analysis while still allowing for transparent and reproducible modeling.\n\n#| label: load-dataset\n#| message: false\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\nCan a linear regression model accurately reproduce Hubble’s Law from observed galaxy data?\nHow does incorporating uncertainty (weighted regression) affect the estimated value of the Hubble Constant?\nWhat limitations arise when applying simple linear models to cosmological data?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\nWeek 1: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis — scatterplots, correlation checks.\nWeek 2: Fit standrad linear regression model and compute slope/intercept.\nWeek 3: Implement weighted regression using uncertainty values to refine\nWeek 4: Visualize residuals, calculate confidence intervals, and compare results to NASA’s published H₀ range.\nWeek 5: Write final report, generate presentation, and interpret discrepancies.\n\n## Organization\nhubble-constant-project/\n│\n├── data/           # Raw and cleaned galaxy datasets\n├── grids/            # EDA and regression\n├── results/            # Plots and summary tables\n├── scripts/          # Python scripts for data and modeling\n├── reports/          # Proposal, final report, presentation\n└── README.md           # Overview and setup instructions\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n- A numerical estimate of H-const with uncertainty analysis.\n- Visualizations (scatterplot with regression line, residual plots).\n- Discussion comparing the computed constant to established cosmological values and sources of error.\n- Reflection on how data-mining and regression methods apply to real scientific data.\n\n",
