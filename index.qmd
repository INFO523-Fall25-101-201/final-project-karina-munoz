## Abstract

This project applies data mining and regression analysis to estimate the Hubble Constant (H₀) using real galaxy velocity–distance data. 
The dataset will be sourced from public astronomical archives such as the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database or Kaggle. 
By cleaning, visualizing, and modeling the data using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, 
the project aims to fit a linear relationship between galaxy recession velocity and distance, derive an estimate of H₀, and 
compare it to published cosmological values (~70 km/s/Mpc). Weighted regression and uncertainty visualization will be used to assess data quality and model 
confidence.
