## Goal / Research Question

- What functional form best describes the relationship between distance and recession velocity?
- How does a simple linear model compare to more flexible models?

- Estimate the Hubble constant (H₀) using supernova data
- Evaluate whether a simple linear Hubble Law fits well

## Data {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Dataset: Pantheon+ supernovae (distance vs recessional velocity)
- Pantheon+ provides high-quality Type Ia supernova distances
- Focus on low-redshift regime where Hubble’s Law applies
- Key variables: distance and velocity (after cleaning)

## Approach {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Baseline model: linear regression (v = H₀ d)
  * Theory predicts proportional increase of velocity with distance
  * Slope provides an estimate of the Hubble constant
- Check fit: residual patterns vs distance
- Compare: linear vs quadratic (as a diagnostic, not expected physically at low z)

## Linear Model {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Theory predicts proportional increase of velocity with distance
- Linear regression used to quantify this relationship
- Slope provides an estimate of the Hubble constant
:::

## Linear Model Performance {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- RMSE ≈ 711 km/s
- MAE low, indicating generally accurate predictions
- High R² shows linear trend explains most variance
:::

## Model Performance {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Linear model fit:
  - R² ≈ 0.98
  - RMSE ≈ 711 km/s
- Estimated Hubble constant:
  - H₀ ≈ 65–67 km/s/Mpc
- MAE low, indicating generally accurate predictions
- High R² shows linear trend explains most variance

## Hubble Diagram {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Strong linear relationship between distance and velocity
- Scatter increases at larger distances

## Residual Analysis {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Residuals mostly random at shorter distances
- Slight trend appears only at largest distances
- Suggests local deviations rather than global nonlinearity

## Quadratic Model Test {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Quadratic regression used to test for curvature
- Expected improvement if curvature were meaningful
- Model performed significantly worse
:::

## Model Comparison {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Linear model RMSE ≈ 711 km/s
- Quadratic model RMSE ≈ 7604 km/s
- Added complexity increases error rather than improving fit
:::

## Residuals & Redshift Test {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Residual scatter increases primarily at highest redshift
- Data split into low-z and high-z subsets
- Low-z: stable slope, low error
- High-z: unstable, noise-dominated

## Interpretation {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Strong positive distance–velocity relationship observed
- Linear model captures dominant physical trend
- Deviations at large distances likely due to observational uncertainty
:::

## Limitations {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Analysis focused on low-redshift supernovae
- Measurement uncertainty increases at large distances
- More complex cosmological models not explored
:::

## Conclusion {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}

- Linear model provides an effective description of expansion at low redshift
- Nonlinear models do not improve predictive performance
- Hubble’s Law remains valid for this dataset
