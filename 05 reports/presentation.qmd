## Goal
- Estimate the Hubble constant (H₀) using Pantheon+ supernova data
- Evaluate whether a simple linear Hubble Law fits well

## Data
- Dataset: Pantheon+ supernovae (distance vs recessional velocity / redshift-based velocity)
- Key variables used: distance and velocity (with any filtering/cleaning described in EDA)

## Approach
- Baseline model: linear regression (v = H₀ d)
- Check fit: residual patterns vs distance
- Compare: linear vs quadratic (as a diagnostic, not expected physically at low z)

## Key Results
- Linear model: R² = 0.983, RMSE = 711 km/s
- Estimated H₀ = 64 km/s/Mpc
- Main takeaway:

## Model Performance

- Linear model fit:
  - R² ≈ 0.98
  - RMSE ≈ 711 km/s
- Estimated Hubble constant:
  - H₀ ≈ 65–67 km/s/Mpc


## Model Comparison

- Linear regression provides a strong baseline fit
- Quadratic model increased error (higher RMSE)
- Added curvature does not improve predictive performance

## Residuals & Interpretation

- Residuals increase slightly with distance
- Pattern suggests growing observational uncertainty at large distances
- No strong evidence that a nonlinear model is required

## Main Takeaway

- Hubble’s Law provides an excellent first-order description of the data
- Linear regression yields a stable estimate of H₀
- More complex models do not improve performance for this dataset
