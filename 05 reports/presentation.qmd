## Goal / Research Question {.smaller}

- What functional form best describes the relationship between distance and recession velocity?
- How does a simple linear model compare to more flexible models?
- Estimate the Hubble constant (H0) using supernova data
- Evaluate whether a linear Hubble Law fits the data well

## Dataset Summary {.smaller}

::: {.tiny}
| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Total supernovae | ~1700 |
| Low-redshift subset (zHD < 0.1) | 645 |
| Velocity range (km/s) | ~300 – 40,000 |
| Luminosity distance range (Mpc) | ~1 – 1,600 |

::: {.smaller}
Analysis focuses on the low-redshift subset where Hubble’s Law is expected to be approximately linear.

## Low-Redshift Model (zHD < 0.1) {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- Analysis restricted to the low-redshift regime where Hubble’s Law is expected to be linear  
- Linear regression fit is tighter than for the full dataset  
- Estimated slope (Hubble constant):  
  **\(H_0 \approx 64.6\ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)**  

**Interpretation**
- Reduced scatter confirms linear behavior in the local universe  
- Supports using a simple linear model to estimate \(H_0\)  
:::

---

## Higher-Redshift Behavior {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
- At higher redshift, residual variance increases noticeably  
- Linear trend remains present, but uncertainty grows  
- Slope estimates become less stable due to:
  - increasing distance uncertainty  
  - cosmological effects beyond linear expansion  

**Implication**
- Higher-redshift data motivate cosmology-aware models  
- Do not justify adding polynomial terms to the low-z model

## Model Performance Comparison {.smaller}

::: {.tiny}
| Model | \(R^2\) | RMSE (km/s) | MAE (km/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear | 0.983 | 711 | 492 |
| Quadratic | 0.986 | 7604 | 448 |

::: {.smaller}
Quadratic regression shows marginal metric improvements but introduces additional complexity.

## Residuals by Redshift {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="48%"}
- Residual variance increases with redshift  
- Indicates non-constant error (heteroskedasticity)  
- Expected due to growing distance uncertainty and reduced dominance of peculiar velocities  

**Implication:**  
Linear trend remains valid, but error structure suggests weighted modeling for future work.

## Why Does Curvature Appear? {.smaller}

- Cosmological distance is not strictly linear:
\[
d_L = (1 + z) r(z)
\]
- Small departures are expected even at low redshift  
- Residual structure reflects physical and observational effects  

---

## Model Interpretation & Justification {.smaller}

::: {.smaller}
**Interpretation**
- Linear slope directly estimates the Hubble constant:  
  \(H_0 \approx 64.6\ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)
- Intercept reflects local velocity effects and calibration offsets

**Justification**
- Linear model captures the dominant trend with minimal complexity
- Quadratic model offers only marginal metric gains
- Added flexibility reduces interpretability and lacks physical motivation at low redshift

**Final choice**
- Linear regression provides the best balance of performance, interpretability, and theory

## Conclusion {.smaller}

- Linear regression provides a strong fit to low-redshift Pantheon+ supernova data  
- Estimated Hubble constant:  
  **\(H_0 \approx 64.6\ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)**  
- Residuals show increasing uncertainty at larger redshifts, but no evidence that added complexity improves the model  
- For the local universe, a linear Hubble Law remains an effective and interpretable model
