    "Before isolating the low-redshift regime, the full luminosity distance–velocity relation exhibits strong curvature. This curvature arises because luminosity distance is a nonlinear cosmological quantity,\n",

    "and because the accelerated expansion of the universe becomes increasingly important at moderate and high redshift. In this regime, the linear approximation is no longer physically appropriate.\n",

    "Even after restricting the sample to $z < 0.1$, residual analysis reveals small systematic deviations at the largest distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residuals increase slightly beyond $\\sim 300$ Mpc  \n",
    "- Weak curvature remains at the high-distance end  \n",
    "- Deviations are consistent with higher-order cosmological effects and increasing measurement uncertainty  \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess whether this curvature justified a more complex model, a quadratic fit was also evaluated. While the quadratic model visually tracks the residual curvature and produces marginally improved summary metrics, the improvement is small relative to observational uncertainties and the limited physical interpretation of the added term.\n",
